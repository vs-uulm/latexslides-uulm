UUlm Latex Beamer Template
==========================

A document class that can be used to create LaTeX `beamer` slides featuring the original UUlm corporate design.

Look at the `example` folder for a working example.


Installation (optional)
-----------------------

The script `install.sh` can be used to install the package into the local `texmf` tree. Alternatively, you can check out the git repository directly into the `texmf` tree.

Usage
-----

If you prefer not to install the template and use self-contained sources instead, place a copy of the files `uulm-slides.cls` and `uulm-logo-color.pdf` in the directory of your slide source file.
